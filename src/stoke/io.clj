;;but also what our average demand is, as in a time-weighted average 
;;demand.


;;The original paradigm had us reading demands from files. 
;;In other words, we generate a corpus of futures, and re-use those 
;;futures for multiple runs.  The implementation of spork.util.table 
;;may be slowing us down on the parsing/IO front, so this avenue may 
;;be a bit rough for large sample sizes of futures.  We'll see..
