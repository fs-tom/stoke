(defn missing-strength [src] (Exception. (str "No strength for src " src)))

;;Rewrite
;;=======
;;Due to complexities in generating "optimal" force structure relative
;;to end-strength, parent-child, and other competing objectives, I
;;have decided to use the existing hierarchical fill function as a
;;primitive value function that forms a sub-goal for a demand-driven
;;supply generator.  The supply generator will use local search to
;;improve upon an initial solution.  Its objective is to find a
;;Supply that minimizes the following objectives:

;;Strength  Under Budget - as defined by Total End Strength
;;Strength  Over Budget  - as defined by an End Strength Constraint Tree
;;Orphaned  Strength     - as defined by a Parent-Child forest.
;;Fill Cost              - as defined by a Fill Network.

;;Thus, the goal of our supply generator is to find a supply, x,  that
;;minimizes the function:
;;  z(x) = a*SUB(x) + b*SOB(x) + c*OS(x) + d*FillCost(x)
;;Where a,b,c,d = goal weights

;;From a high level view, Fill Cost is the mincost maxflow occuring
;;when we solve the FillNetwork resulting from the function
;;(make-fill-net demand s)
;;applied to a demand future, and an empty Supply solution s.

;;Current defaults to the strength built into the supply solution.
(defn strength-under-budget [supply]

;;We have a tree of end strength constraints that link together
;;dependent pools.  For each [src,pool] key within the supply,
;;we can accumulate the total for the pool.  Tracing the
;;parents of each pool, we can store a quantity in each supply
;;pool node (in the graph) that indicates the amount of supply
;;present related to the nodes on the pool path.  Initial values
;;for the nodes start at the capacities for the nodes, and
;;we simply decrement the strength associated with the node.  We
;;continue decrementing up to the root (Total).

;;Filling Optimally
;;=================
;;We build a demand-driven supply-generator that creates supply by
;;optimally investing constrained resources relative to a demand
;;future.

;;Our basic mechanism for expressing both constraints and objectives
;;will be a fairly sophisticated network.  Our intent is that
;;computing the mincost flow across the network will result in a flow
;;of resources that describes the optimal investment of force
;;structure relative to preferences embedded in the topology of the
;;network.

;;We'll then discuss two different ways to "solve" the network flow
;;problem, either hierarchically (filling from the most important
;;sinks to the least important) or simultaneosly.

;;Network Topology
;;================
;;Any mincost flow optimization is relatively simple in formulation:

;;Where G=(N,A)  a directed network with n nodes and m arcs (n x m
;;matrix), defined by a set of nodes N, and a set of arcs A
;;Each arc within A has cost Cij, capacity Uij, lower bound Lij on
;;arc flow,

;;Cmax = Infinity
;;a map of flow constraints b,  where
;;b(i) = supply for node i if b(i)>0, else demand if b(i)<0

;;minimize the function Z(X) = sum(ij)(Cij*Xij), for all i,j within A
;;Such That
;;sum(Xij)      -       sum(Xji) = b(i) ;Constrained flow conservation
;;for all i,j within A, for all j,i within A

;;Given such a network, we can solve Z using a number of mincost flow
;;routines, namely the mincost flow solver in spork.cljgraph.flow

;;Our goal is to define the elements that are reified into either
;;capacitated arcs (possible flows), supply nodes, demand nodes, and
;;arc costs.  In other words, the bulk of our effort is spent building
;;the network from some external data.

;;In general, we can think of the desired network G, or the Fill
;;Network, as the composition of two smaller networks:

;;Supply Dependencies
;;===================
;;The rest of the supply network encodes so-called existential, or organic
;;dependencies between elements of supply.  For many types of supply,
;;supply is preferably produced in conjunction with an organic "whole"
;;unit.  An element of supply may be referenced in a demand, but the
;;actual capability may come from a larger "bundle" resident in an
;;organic unit.  Consequently, an optimal fill should account for the
;;fact that elements of supply are existentially or organically
;;related via a tree of parent-child dependencies.  Thus, flow is more
;;efficiently obtained by investing in parent structure

;;A dependency tree - a set of arcs between parent,child SRCs, where
;;weights are child quantities

;;A map of demand to inorganic cost - or - preferably a single cost
;;Co, which is typically IntMax.

;;A map of demand to priority
;;A map of SRC to Strength
;;A map of FillRule to demand preference

;;A preference tree - a set of of arcs between parent, child
;;FillRules, which represents a demand's preferred supply.

;;=====================================


;;Update:
;;We were incorrectly applying the filters read in from SupplyNode
;;filters, and effectively reversing the intent of the filter.
;;The only filters currently allowed are exclusionary filters,
;;pre-fixed by :not in the data.  The filter should function,
;;semantically, like filter in clojure, i.e. only src / rule
;;pairs that are valid should pass the filter.
;;For the cabs, we had a [:not RCAD] filter to eval.  I
;;added an extra not inside of the the valid? local function
;;definition, which caused us to select ONLY on the RCAD
;;and exclude everything else.  In fact, we wanted to exclude
;;RCAD and allow all others.  This has been fixed by removing
;;the (not ...) and allowing the filter to act normally.
;;I probably need to spend a little more time fleshing out the
;;semantics of the filter, but for now it's okay.

;;Our standardized fill network is pretty simple...
;;We take a normal supply-network, and created zero-cost, inf capacity

;;This serves as the basis for a dynamic fill network, which we mutate

;;We stub in a universal :demand node, that sits right before
;;a universal :filled node.  This setup ensures that, under a
;;topological sorting of the nodes, the :filled node is last,
;;the :demand node is second-to-last.  This allows us to trivially
;;modify the topology of the network.  We basically just read in
;;information from the demand, particularly the rule and the src.
;;From there, we mutate the topology of the network to disable or
;;enable edges between rule-nodes and the :demand node.
;;We then alter the capacity of the [:demand :filled] edge to
;;reflect the quantity demanded.
